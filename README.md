# SystemTextJsonPatch

SystemTextJsonPatch is a JSON Patch (JsonPatchDocument) RFC 6902 implementation for .NET using System.Text.Json

This library tries to ease the migration from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json by providing
similar API for HttpPatch requests as in [Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Features/JsonPatch) and [Marvin.JsonPatch](https://github.com/KevinDockx/JsonPatch)

* Designed as an easy replacement for Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch
* Supports .NET 6.0+
